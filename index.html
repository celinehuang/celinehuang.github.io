                  I'm currently in my fourth year at McGill studying computer
                  science and mathematics.

                  Before university, I had no programming experience. My first
                  proper experience with programming came in my second semester
                  of first year, when I took COMP 202. I learned a lot of the
                  fundamentals, and I was officially on my way with my computer
                  science major.

                  In Fall 2018 I joined McGill Formula Electric's Controls Team,
                  where I helped to implement and test safety checks for the
                  throttle control while adjusting the software based on the
                  team’s car. This car later won first place overall in FSAE
                  Electrical Championships. The next fall, I joined the first
                  Canadian chapter of
                  <a href="https://hack4impact-mcgill.now.sh/"> Hack4Impact</a>,
                  where we build software for non-profit organizations to help
                  drive positive social impact.

                  summer. HubSpot is located in Boston and they build software
                  products tools for social media marketing, content management,
                  web analytics, and search engine optimization.

                <p>Online Marketplace for Buy and Sell</p>
                <section>
                  Since I am an avid user of Amazon, the online buy and sell
                  marketplace project topic caught my eye. As busy students, I
                  find that we often have trouble meal prepping for school after
                  a long day. An online marketplace idea I have is creating an
                  application that would allow you to submit links of a recipe
                  you'd like to make, and then it'd return you a pre-selected
                  list of ingredients from a online grocery store. After
                  de-selecting ingredients (so you don't own 10 salt shakers),
                  you can purchase the groceries with just one click and have
                  them delivered to your front door without having to make
                  multiple trips to the grocery store if you forget an
                  ingredient. You may also simply just select individual
                  ingredients you want to purchase or even selecting what you've
                  previously bought - making meal prepping and cooking a lot
                  easier and enjoyable!

                Fun fact: I play competitive ultimate frisbee (usually known as
                just Ultimate). Since high school, I’ve played on several
                high-level teams, including the British Columbia junior team,
                team Montreal, and the McGill Ultimate Team where we placed top
                four in the country!
